                    <strong>Bastion</strong>
                    <img class="dog" src="bastion.jpg" rel="bastion">
                    Taking the top spot on our list is Bastion. This hero may not be the fastest character in the game, but what he lacks in speed he more than makes up for in firepower. With his overpowered machine gun, Bastion can melt through other heroes like a hot knife through butter. In fact, he's become notorious for being able to take down even the most resilient of enemies. </div>

                    <strong>Soldier</strong>
                    <img class="dog" src="soldier.jpg" rel="soldier">
                    Soldier is widely considered one of the most versatile heroes in Overwatch. His well-rounded set of abilities make him a valuable asset in any team composition, and his quick movement speed is a key factor in his ability to outmaneuver and outsmart enemies.

                    <strong>Reinhardt</strong>
                    <img class="dog" src="reinhardt.jpg" rel="reinhardt">
                    Reinhardt is often considered one of the best tanks in Overwatch, and for good reason. His commanding presence and massive hammer strikes make him a force to be reckoned with on the battlefield.
